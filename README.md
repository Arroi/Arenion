# what is arenion?
Arenion is a website that sends inputs to your discord webhook.
# can I modify it?
It's an OSP (Open source program) so you could modify it whatever you want to!
# Tell me about it.

Arenion is actually intended for educational purposes on how you can react with webhooks in discord.
you can remove the basic template that I've provided for you, and you could modify the template with whatever you need. 
I've taken some assets from my earlier projects this months so you may see many stuff that are not supposed to be there, haha!
overall, check out this simple js program. documents can be found soon cause I'm working on documenting all of my projects.
# What do I need it for?
You could need it for.. anything honestly. as long as you know what you're working with.

# How do I modify the embed?
you can find everything inside index.html folder.
# I'm new it JS, how can I modify the rest of arenion?
I'll make a tutorial about it soon, checkout my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/@itsyoboiarroi if I have posted anything on it yet.
